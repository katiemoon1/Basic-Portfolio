            <p>Hi there! I am Katie Moon and welcome to my portfolio! I currently reside outside of Cleveland, OH, where I work as a Research Chemist for an electrochemical company. Having a background in research has helped hone my problem solving skills and attention to detail. It has also cultivated a deeper sense of curiosity. I hope that these characteristics shine through with the projects I have completed and have on display!</p>
            <p>In my spare time, you can find in at a coffeeshop with my head buried in a book. I absolutely love reading! Or if I have the time, hiking and traveling around the world! Being in nature is something that I hold dear to my heart. I always feel at home and completely refreshed after being out in the wilderness.</p>
